# Allies Central.

Welcome back ally!
Ready for another adventure? We're not quite there yet, but don't worry. You can always test what we have instore, sign up for the beta testing program or preorder the game on our site.

##About the game.
AJ had been recruited by the most elite hacking organisation. The salary's good and they treat him well. He thinks he's landed the best job going, but before he can settle in things take a turn for the worse...

Embark on a rollercoaster of emotions and action alongside AJ, tackle the hardest programs and climb the ladder of success. Remember your objective and forget your past because once you join Allies Central, there's no turning back.

The game is available for beta testing. Simply sign up on the website and wait for one of the developers to get back to you. Due to the increasing amount of beta testers we may reject your request but don't lose hope, theres still a ton of options to get your hands dirty. Maybe your good at coding or your HTML skills are elite or maybe you think you can manage the project or the site. Maybe you have something that we can use :)
The devs will give you a list of options, if you think one of them is for you simply reply back and quote the option number. Leave the rest to the devs.

##Why we chose GitHub.
GitHub is the best in our opinion. It's easy to use and its free. The best thing is that you can host your website for free. We decided to host our website on GitHub to save costs and minimize the time of our project, we even made the repository public so programmers like you could chip in. What's in it for you? You get to have your name on the webiste and on the rolling credits of the game, if your lucky you might even get paid. What are you waiting for? Contact one of the developers and shoot your ideas at them. Who knows, maybe your idea fuels the sequel to the game?!

##How to get your hands dirty?
The game is still in alpha development so the bugs are everywhere. Maybe you can help iron them out, if you think you're up for the challenge, sign up for testing on our website and the developers will explain the rest.

##When will the game be available?
We hope to get the game out by October next year, but you can never estimate success.
